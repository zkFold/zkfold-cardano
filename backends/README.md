# Off-chain for transactions

All backends for basic transactions in zkfold-cardano.

Now we have two backends written to create tokens and withdraw money.

Soon this place will become a library, and the executable files will be part of the zk infrastructure.

1) Plonk for minting tokens
2) Symbolic for certificate and withdraw
