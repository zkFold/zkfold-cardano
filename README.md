# zkFold Symbolic demo project

ZKFold Symbolic is a high-level programming language for zero-knowledge smart contracts, a subset of Haskell. It targets arithmetic circuits, the language used in various zero-knowledge protocols.

The language is a part of the `zkfold-base` package. You can compile functions and expressions using the `compile` function from `ZkFold.Symbolic.Compiler` module.

## Building the project

This project can be built with Cabal 3.6.2.0 and GHC 8.10.7.
